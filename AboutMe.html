   <br><center><div> Hello my name is Aidan and I am a 18 yr old student that goes to humber college.<br>
   A have a swiss background because both my parents were born there and ended up migrating here, where I was born in Canada.<br>
   This is the reason why I can now speak some german as I took lesson's at a school growing up.

   Also growing up I went to Holy Angels Catholic School and Bishop Allen Catholic School and am now entrolled in Humber College. <br>

   Also growing up I have played a few sports such as Hockey Baseball and Soccer. I have made a chart showing what years i have played these sports
   I never played any of these sports competiviely but I still enjoyed them.</div></center>
